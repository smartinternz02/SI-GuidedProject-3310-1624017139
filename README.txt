Most of the customers will follow and choose the best restaurants on the basis of reviews and ratings. So reviews Play a Crucial Role in any model or system. The approach to this problem is based on review text content analysis and uses the principles of natural language process (the NLP method) and Machine learning. After applying the above method we can classify whether it is a positive review or negative review and can also visualize the total no of positive reviews and negative reviews. We are working on developing an algorithm that can help in classifying the reviews on the basis of positive and negative reviews with the help of a predefined dictionary of words.
